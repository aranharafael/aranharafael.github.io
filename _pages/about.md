Hi, I'm a professor at Rio de Janeiro State University, belonging to the Institute of Physics, member of the Department of Theoretical Physics and active in the Gravitation and Cosmology group. I have a bachelor's degree in Physics, obtained in 2006, by the same university and a doctor's degree in Physical Sciences, obtained in 2011, by the Brazilian Center for Physical Research. I also went through a two-year specialization period as a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in the city of Atlanta, USA. The author works mainly in the area of Numerical Relativity, more precisely in the construction of codes associated with numerical solutions of the equations of General Relativity. Such solutions allow the study of important astrophysical systems, such as gravitational wave emission, gravitational collapse and black hole formation. In addition, the author has a great interest in branches of Mathematical Physics focused on the Einsteinian theory of gravitation. In the complementary field to basic research, I develop projects for the inclusion of computational technologies, as well as projects related to teaching and training new researchers, both in order to expand the research segment of Numerical Relativity in Brazil.
