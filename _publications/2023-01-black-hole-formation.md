> **Abstract**

The intellectual development around the formation of black holes has a very rich history, as it does not onlyinvolve technical issues particular to the theory of general relativity. The full understanding of gravitationalcollapse both discusses various topics of relativistic astrophysics, as well as evidences the participation of many ofthe greatest physicists in the history of science. This article aims to address, in an introductory and conceptualway, the main characteristics of the formation of black holes, in a chronological line of initial rejection, followedby their inevitable acceptance.
