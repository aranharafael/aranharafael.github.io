> **Abstract**

We show that gravitational wave radiative patterns from a point test particle falling radially into a Schwarzschild black hole, as derived by Davis, Ruffini, Press and Price, are present in the nonlinear regime of head-on mergers of black holes. We use the Bondi-Sachs characteristic formulation and express the gravitational wave luminosity and the radiated energy in terms of the news functions. Our treatment is made in the realm of Robinson-Trautman dynamics, with characteristic initial data corresponding to the head-on merger of two black holes. We consider mass ratios in the range 0.01 ≤ α ≤ 1. We obtain the exponential decay with ℓ of the total energy contributed by each multipole ℓ. The total rescaled radiated energy EWtotal /m0α2 decreases linearly with decreasing α, yielding for the point particle limit α → 0 the value ≃ 0.0484, about five times larger than the result of Davis et al. We also analyze the mode decomposition of the net momentum flux and the associated impulse of the gravitational waves emitted, resulting in an adjacent-even-odd mode-mixing pattern with the dominant contribution coming from the mixed mode (2, 3). We obtain the exponential decay with ℓ of the total gravitational wave impulse contributed by each (ℓ, ℓ + 1) mixed mode.
