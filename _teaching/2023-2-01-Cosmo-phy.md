> Introductory cosmology for physics students.

## Goals


At the end of the semester, the student should be able to identify the main concepts surrounding the standard model of cosmology, both from a theoretical and observational point of view. This encompasses the various topics about the universe, from our location in the Milky Way, to the structure of the universe on a large scale. The student will also learn about the theoretical modeling of the expansion of the universe and its direct consequences.
